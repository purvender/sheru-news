🛡️ API Security
User authentication and API access is secured using JWT tokens.
Public endpoints:
/api/auth/register
/api/auth/login
Protected endpoints require the Authorization header:
plaintext
Copy code
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
🌐 APIs Overview
Here are some key endpoints:

Authentication
POST /api/auth/register: Register a new user.
POST /api/auth/login: Log in and get a JWT.
Articles
GET /api/articles: Get a list of all articles.
POST /api/articles: Create a new article (admin only).
PUT /api/articles/{id}: Update an article (admin only).
DELETE /api/articles/{id}: Delete an article (admin only).
Categories
GET /api/categories: Get a list of all categories.
For a complete API list, refer to the Swagger documentation (if enabled).

🐞 Troubleshooting
Database Connection Issues: Ensure MySQL is running and the credentials in application.properties are correct.
JWT Authentication Fails: Verify that the jwt.secret matches the one used for token creation.
Caching Errors: Ensure Redis is running and accessible.
